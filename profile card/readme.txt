Hello,
My name is Vishal, who has stated a 30-day challenge in corporation with front-end mentor.io
This project's name is Profile Card Component  #(Challenge 1)
In this Profile Card Component project, I used only HTML and CSS, where in CSS I took the help of :
CSS:    CSS-grid, Flexbox, images, and basic properties of CSS.
This costs me a 3 hour project, where 2hr 15 mins been took by CSS, and 45 mins in HTML.

I would be very happy to see if any improvement can be done in this project.
